Questions:

1. Where to place `relationships`, at *1* or *2* ?

   No `relationships` in message. So neither *1* nor *2*.

2. How to present `relationships` ?

   Relationships is presented in config file (like [setting_template.py](setting_template.py)). There are functions presented relationships in `messages_to_receive` .

3. Contains `to_entity_id` or not, at *3* or *4* ?

   Contains it and at *4*.

4. Who acts as `External` and how to deal with `External` ?

   An special entity acts as `External` . Use `external_main.py` to deal with `External` .
